This is an exercise in using pandas in Python.

OBJECTIVE: 
Use Pandas to modify books.csv from https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k. 
Save the modified data to an worksheets in an xlsx differentiated by publication century.

REQUIREMENTS:
books.py was written using Python version 3.9.7.

MAINTENANCE:
This repository will likely not be updated after 1/11/2022.

CONTENTS: 
books.csv, books.py, books_by_century.xlsx,

books.csv - book data sourced from goodbooks-10k
books.py - program code
books_by_century.xlsx - the output file resulting from books.py

DESIGN:
The code in books.py is written in one block without the use of functions. 
Since the purpose of this project was to become familiarized with pandas and not for repeatability,
little thought went into the design.
